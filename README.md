# bitpredict

This project aims to make high frequency bitcoin price predictions from market microstructure data. The dataset is a series of one-second snapshots of open buy and sell orders, combined with a record of executed transactions. A collection of engineered features is used to train a Gradient Boosting model. Live model performance can currently be viewed at bitpredict.io.
